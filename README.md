# Top 10 Movies
### Backend Project

## Overview

This website displays movies on the homepage that are stored in the movies database.
You are able to add new movies, delete movies and also edit the rating and review for any movie. All changes will be made to the database.

This was a backend project as part of a Python course I study in my free time.
I was responsible for only the backend development of this website.

This will take you to a page where you can input the title 
of the movie you would like to add to the database.

Using The Movie DataBase API (TMDB) this will then present a list of all the movies in the TMDB.
Click on the movie you would like to add. 

You'll then need to add a rating and review of the movie then click Done.
